# unreasonablemicroservice
Simple microservice to make SCP: Secret Laboratory webhook server reports a little bit better

# what gives
![don't you think it looks much better?](whatgives.png)

# but why though?
well someone said that this is just, you know, \*impossible\*, since you can't really adjust webhook json via server configs, as it is hardcoded inside the game

oh and also it looks much better in my opinion
